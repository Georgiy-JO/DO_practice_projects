The worst monsters are the ones we create.
Death comes for all of us, eventually. The only way to cheat it is to have a legacy.
My world is cruel and predictable. You enter, you survive, you die.
I forge my own path. ...
I'm not a good man. ...
People linked by destiny will always find each other.
Destiny is a beast.
